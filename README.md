## First Steps in Front-End Web Development

This project marks my first steps into the world of front-end web development after having only dealt with backend development in my last semester. Here's what I learned:

### HTML
HTML forms the backbone of web pages. In this project, I used HTML to structure the web application, including elements such as buttons, toggle switches, dropdown menus, and result fields

### CSS
CSS was used to style the web application, giving it a modern and user-friendly appearance. I explored various CSS properties for layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design. This was my first experience with customizing the look and feel of a web page.

### JavaScript
JavaScript brought interactivity to the application. I learned how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically generate passwords, handle user input, and implement clipboard functionality for copying passwords.
